# Project Overview
This Django-based web application provides various functionalities, including user authentication, text-based model interaction, and image processing for medical analysis.

## Features

### 1. **Home Page (Text-Based Model Interaction)**
   - Users can input text queries into the system.
   - The model processes the input and generates a response.
   - Previous user interactions are stored and displayed.

### 2. **User Authentication**
   - Users can log in using their email and password.
   - Authentication is handled using Django's built-in user model.
   - Invalid login attempts return an error message.

### 3. **MRI Scan Report Analysis**
   - Users can upload an MRI scan image.
   - The image is processed and analyzed using a pre-trained model.
   - The result is displayed on the webpage.

### 4. **Cell Image Processing**
   - Users can upload cell images for analysis.
   - Images are processed and transformed using OpenCV.
   - The processed image is displayed back to the user.

## Technologies Used
- Django (Python Web Framework)
- TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning Model)
- OpenCV (Image Processing)
- Wikipedia API (Optional Text Processing)
- PIL (Image Handling)
