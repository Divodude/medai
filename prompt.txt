I am not feeling good from last night i havve shivering and joint pain and fever
"I'm not feeling well and have been experiencing several concerning symptoms. It all started with a high fever that came on suddenly, and it's been persistent for the past few days. Along with the fever, I've been having really bad headaches, especially around my eyes; it feels like there's pressure building up behind them. My muscles and joints ache a lot, and it's making it difficult to move around. I also feel extremely tired and weak, even after resting. My skin has become very sensitive, and sometimes it looks a bit red, almost like a rash is developing. I've also noticed some mild nausea and occasionally feel like I might throw up, though it hasnâ€™t happened yet. Overall, I just feel extremely run down and unwell, and the symptoms don't seem to be getting any better. Could this be something serious, like dengue?"
I can't seem to catch my breath and I'm sweating a lot. I feel really sick and have a lot of phlegm in my throat. My chest hurts and my heart is racing. The mucus I'm coughing up is brownish and stringy.
